### Abstract: 
Given the profound physiological changes astronauts undergo during space missions, research on the long-term impact of decreased gravity environments on bone density, muscle mass, and strength is essential. Extended periods of microgravity exposure accelerate bone loss and muscle atrophy, causing health hazards and reducing astronauts' physical capacities in space and when they return to Earth. In order to preserve musculoskeletal health during space missions, it is imperative to comprehend these impacts in order to create effective countermeasures and determine the best exercise regimens, dietary plans, and maybe pharmaceutical therapies. Similar health problems on Earth, such osteoporosis and muscle wasting illnesses, may be helped by this understanding as well.

In order to create preventive and therapeutic measures, investigating the long-term impacts of low gravity settings on bone density, muscular mass, and strength is essential. Fundamental requirements encompass comprehending bone demineralization and muscle atrophy in microgravity, determining efficacious workout routines and dietary therapies, and investigating novel technology such as artificial gravity systems. The goal is to provide all-encompassing methods that reduce the degradation of the musculoskeletal system during space missions and expedite the astronauts' return to Earth for recovery and rehabilitation. This research has implications for enhancing musculoskeletal healthcare on Earth in addition to supporting astronauts' health and performance.
